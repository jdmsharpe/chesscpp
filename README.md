# Chess in C++

Nothing fancy, just a naive implementation as a personal project.

## Remaining Work
* Detect checkmate
* Detect if a move blocks check/protects king
* Detect stalemate
* Observe half-move rule
* Update unit tests for Board
* FEN output of arbitrary board state (stretch goal)
* Graphics (stretch goal)
